# Exeter Maths Notes compiled by James Arthur

I studied my undergraduate degree at the University of Exeter and spent my time
between the two campus' taking modules in Pure and Applied Maths. Here you will
find some compiled notes from my time at Exeter.

NB! I was the last cohort of the Penryn Undergraduate courses, so you may see
changes to some things in respect to how they are taught in Stretham although
they have the same name, i.e. Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus.

## Year I
I compiled a selection of notes for our advanced calculus course, they are
