# Exeter Maths Notes compiled by James Arthur

I studied my undergraduate degree at the University of Exeter and spent my time
between the two campus' taking modules in Pure and Applied Maths. Here you will
find some compiled notes from my time at Exeter.

NB! I was the last cohort of the Penryn Undergraduate courses, so you may see
changes to some things in respect to how they are taught in Streatham although
they have the same name, i.e. Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus.

## Year I
I compiled a selection of notes for our Advanced Calculus (Professor Stuart Townley) course, they are
[here](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y1/ECM1905-AdCalc/0CompletedAdCalcNotes.pdf)

## Year II
Here's selected notes from Second Year:

### T1
Most of these will be refactored at some point
* Real Analysis (Dr. Mark Callaway) - [Real Analysis](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y2/MTH2008-RealAnal/RAnal/RAnal.pdf)
* Vector Calculus (Dr. Hamid Alemi Ardakani) - [Vector Calculus](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y2/ECM2908-VecCalc/CompleteNotes/notes.pdf)
* Differential Equation (Dr. Saptarshi Das) - [Differential Equations](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/tree/main/Y2/ECM2903-DEs)

### T2
* Linear Algebra (Dr. Mark Callaway) - [Linear Algebra](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y2/ECM2902-LinearAlg/notes.pdf)
* Complex Analysis (Dr. Ana Rodrigues) - [Complex Analysis](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y2/MTH2009-CompAnal/notes.pdf)

## Year III
Here are some selected notes from third year:

### T1
* Dynamical Systems and Control (Dr. Tim Hughes) - [Dynamical Systems and Control](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y3/ECM3907-DSaC/notes.pdf)
* Groups, Rings and Fields (Prof. Mohammed Sa\"idi) - [Groups, Rings and Fields](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y3/MTH2010-GRF/notes.pdf)
* Number Theory (Prof. Henri Johnston) - [Number Theory](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y3/MTH3004-NumberTheory/notes.pdf)
* MathsBio (Dr Ozgur Akman and Dr Marc Goodfellow) - [MathsBio](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y3/MTH3006-MathsBio/notes.pdf)

There also exist some notes I am writing for my dissertation, they are based around Geometric Mechanics and Lie Groups. They can be found [here](https://github.com/jamesa9283/ExeterMathsNotes/blob/main/Y3/Dissertation/notes.pdf)
