# ECM1905 Notes

This is a repo consisting of the notes from the Exeter PEnryn Module, Advanced Calculus. I just compiled the Beamer slides into a LaTeX document. All the Maths is Stuarts.

## Where are the notes? It's a mess in here...

The notes are in `0CompletedAdCalcNotes.pdf`, the rest is how Stuart wanted his diagrams to be. So ignore most of this unless you know how to TeX.

## Theres a mistake on page x?

Make a pull request! I'd be happy to iron any mistakes I made in compiling this!
